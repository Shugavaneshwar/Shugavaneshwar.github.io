## Projects
### CleanMeet AI
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/NickStrain/CleanMeetAI)

Clean Meet AI is a real-time content safety system for video conferencing. It continuously monitors video, audio, and text streams during online meetings to detect and prevent NSFW visuals, offensive speech, and toxic chat messages.<br />
Built a real-time AI system to monitor video, audio, and text streams, reducing NSFW and toxic content exposure by 90% in online meetings.<br />

Achieved 95%+ detection accuracy across multimodal content with <200ms latency, ensuring seamless and safe conferencing.<br />

Integrated with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, enabling scalability across 100% of major conferencing platforms.<br />
