## Projects
### Neural Machine Translation for Tamil
[GitHub Link](github.com/NickStrain/Machine-Translation.git)

Developed a model aiming to achieve a BLEU score of 41, surpassing current benchmarks for Tamil language translation models.\n
Optimized the model to achieve high performance with minimal processing power, reducing computational requirements by 20% compared to baseline models.\n
Processed and binarized the Bharath Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), containing 8GB of sentence pairs for Tamil language, for training.\n

### Image Captioning: 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/NickStrain/Image-Captioning.git)

Built a model that annotates images with relevant captions, achieving a BLEU score of 0.5, indicating high relevance and accuracy.
Utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features such as color, shape, and texture from images.
Reduced training time by 30% through efficient preprocessing and model optimization techniques.

### Satellite Image Segmentation: 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/NickStrain/Image-Captioning.git)

Designed a model to segment satellite images into classes like land, water, and roads, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 78%.
Combined U-Net with ViT (Vision Transformer) to enhance accuracy while requiring only 1,500~ labeled images, demonstrating effectiveness with low data.
Achieved a loss function value of 0.68, outperforming standard models on similar datasets by 15%.
